## Inspiration
When dealing with your used items, knowing what’s recyclable and what isn’t is often a challenge. Different materials might need to be sorted and recycled separately. Trash placed in recycling bins decreases the efficiency of recycling centers, damages equipment, and can contaminate actual recyclables. Recycle Bun is a fun game that encourages recycling and reminds players of proper recycling procedures.

## What it does
Recycle Bun is a “bullet dodge” or “barrage” game, where the player controls a responsible bunny who is trying to properly recycle different items. Ingame, items approach the player character, some recyclable and some not. The player must avoid the trash and pick up the recyclable items. The player must also switch between the appropriate bins (paper, plastic, or glass) when picking up recyclables.

## How we built it
We built this game using Unity game engine and C# scripts. 

## Challenges we ran into
This was our first time using Unity and our first time writing any code in C# so we spent a lot of time reading tutorials and looking at examples. We ran into some trouble with managing and switching between all of the different animation sequences. It was also a little difficult to figure out the navigation between our different screens.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are extremely proud that we managed created a fully functional, finished game within 48 hours with no prior experience with Unity or C#. We used no templates and created all visual assets/animations by ourselves. Two members had worked on a text-based game before, but this was our first time working on a game like this.

## What we learned
We learned a lot about Unity, from how to create animation sequences, to managing different screens, to adding corresponding audio clips. Everything we created in Recycle Bun was what we learned in the past 48 hours.

## What's next for Recycle Bun
We’d like to progressively harder levels and a global multiplayer leaderboard. We’d also like to give players cosmetic options for the bunny character.
